# DESIGN CHOICES SUMMARY
  * Multiple people can have the same username for simplicity's sake, this however means whoever picked that username first will get_digit
    all the messages sent to that username
  * Dictionary used for commands/protocol functions, making heavy use of splitting a protocol into it's operator and operands
    very scalable with little code overhead.
  * Very simple logging capabilities as dictated by the project spec, I did however add whispers and usernames changes to the log.
  * Disallowing of spaces in usernames so they can be used in the protocol as separators, this has little impact on the user but keeps
    the code lightweight.
  * Note: split_command would be put in a common utils.py file but I'm not sure if extra files are allowed so I copied it into both client & server.
